# Min Heap Implementation

This project implements a min heap data structure with bit manipulation operators for parent and child indexing.

## Features

- Build a min heap from an array
- Insert a new element into the heap
- Pop the minimum (root) element from the heap
- Peek at the minimum element
- Generic support for different data types (int, float, custom objects)
- Efficient heapification

Run the examples:

    ```bash
    python examples.py
    ```
## Example

Here's an example of the output you'll see when running the example script:

Building heap from array: [5, 9, 3, 10, 4, 8, 1, 7] Heap: [1, 4, 3, 7, 9, 8, 5, 10]

Inserting element 2 into heap. Heap: [1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 8, 5, 10, 9]

Peek the minimum element: 1

Pop the minimum element: 1 Heap: [2, 4, 3, 7, 9, 8, 5, 10]

Popping all elements from the heap: Popped: 2 Heap: [3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 8, 10]
